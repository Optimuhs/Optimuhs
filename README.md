### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Francisco Martinez
I've been interested in programming since I was introduced to coding by a close friend, which prompted me to take several courses during my university career. Since then, I've grown to enjoy the software development process, allowing me to create tools for necessities at previous jobs. I appreciate the interpreted nature of Python and JavaScript, though I can also value the static typing behind TypeScript for its improvements in code maintainability. Now, I'm eager to contribute my skills in a collaborative environment, learn from experienced developers, and make meaningful contributions to projects. If you're hiring and looking for a motivated team member, let's connect!
